# dcos-splunk-usermap
Splunk dashboard that shows app-user mappings in DC/OS.

Currently it's based only on DC/OS logs, so operates only from historical standpoint â€“ apps that were spawned during certain amount of time, there is no option to show apps running now. 

To configure, add your clusters to search scope selection menu.

### Spawned apps per group
